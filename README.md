# PythonProlog
Prolog interpreter written in Python.

It is planned to be used as a basis for a machine learning approach to learn in which order
the predicates should be executed. This way the progammer might, as the original idea of prolog, just
concentrate on the rules.

The test.pl file shows some usage and is executed before starting the prolog console.
